This project is a Dev Ops assignment we were given late September 2025. The aim of this project is for us to demonstrate teamwork while using agile and showcasing Dev Ops principles. 

We were given a scenario to help us achieve these goals:  
Imagine that each of the divisions in the VIS Media
software development company have been allocated
new projects. Your allocated team works for one of these
divisions. You will contribute to the success of the
development project by contributing to the early
planning and pipeline development.
Your customers are representative of real customers.
They require a lot but for a small price. They are prone to
changing their mind.
Each of your customers are trying to beat popularity trends and become the most popular for this
year.


Further Information:
VIS Media are working on a new game for the Demon Slayer franchise. The film just came out and
was more popular than originally anticipated so the timeline to get the project completed is short.
You need to create your pipeline to support the development of the game.

Each student must create a github repository and demonstrate the required aspects of a DevOps
pipeline. 
Each student is assigned to a team to discuss aspects of the pipeline to help justify the
selection of each product or technique. 
However, each student must create their own pipeline.
Marking is individual. Remember that your pipeline is unique to those of other members of the class
(team) but you should treat this as a team project in that all projects should be able to be combined
at the end of the year.


Topics to hit:
Version Control 
High quality version control including: justified branching strategy, regular use of PRs, 2 commits minimum per week; commits and related messages align with issues, scoping, etc. 

Project Managment

Quality- Autodoc and linters 
Commenting present but could be improved; ok documentation; some evidence of automation; linters shown, but little evidence of understanding the impact of a linter 

Quality- Security and performance 
Evidence of understanding and practice of security and performance; links to left shift but some room for improvement 

IaC, Observability monitoring and logging 
Automated infrastructure with some consideration to failure; observability applied 

Continuous deployment: packaging and deploy 
Clear strategy and application of automated packaging and deployment. 

Conclusion Interview 
Answered questions very well showing an understanding of pipelines and DevOps. An understanding of strategy was also demonstrated.
